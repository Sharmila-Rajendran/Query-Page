                    <summary>Why is the  moon sometimes out during the day?</summary>
                    <p>When we see the moon during the day it's because the moon is in the right spot in the sky and it's reflecting enough light to be as bright, or brighter, than the sky.</p>

                    <summary>Why is the sky blue?</summary>
                    <p>Blue light is scattered more than the other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves.</p>

                    <p>Although no extraterrestrial life has been found and life may still be just a rarity from Earth, there are scientific reasons to suspect that it can exist elsewhere, and technological advances that may detect it if it does.</p>

                    <summary>How do airplanes stay up?</summary>
                    <p>An aircraft in straight and level flight is acted upon by four forces: lift, gravity, thrust and drag. The opposing forces balance each other: Lift equals gravity, and thrust equals drag. Thrust: The force that moves an airplane forward through the air. Thrust is created by a propeller or a jet engine.</p>
